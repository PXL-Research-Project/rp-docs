## Crash Course Computer Science

### Programming Basics: Statements & Functions

Fundamental coding concepts like variables, assignment statements, and loops are introduced here as the building blocks of software. It explains how functions allow programmers to package complex logic into reusable modules, hiding unnecessary detail.

### Intro to Algorithms

Algorithms are the specific steps used to solve a problem, such as sorting a list or finding the shortest path on a map. This video compares the efficiency of different methods using Big O notation, demonstrating why better algorithms are essential for large-scale data.

### Data Structures

To organize information efficiently, computer scientists use data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and trees. Choosing the right structure, such as a binary tree for searching or a queue for processing tasks, can significantly optimize software performance.

### Early Programming

The history of programming is traced from the physical punch cards of the Jacquard loom to the Von Neumann architecture used today. It describes the labor-intensive process of panel programming and the shift toward storing programs directly in electronic memory.

### The First Programming Languages

As machine code became too complex for humans to manage, assembly languages and the first compilers were developed. High-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL allowed programmers to write code once and run it on different machine architectures.

### Alan Turing

This episode honors Alan Turing, the father of computer science, who formalized the mathematical limits of computation with the Turing Machine. It also covers his vital role in codebreaking during World War II and his early contributions to artificial intelligence.
